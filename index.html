                  <h3>Recipes tell a story</h3>
                  <p>Notice how many of Grandma's cookbooks begin with introductions to the staples of their collection of recipes? Those pages aren't just taking up space. Consider those ingredient dossiers the chef's way of making a personal introduction.</p>

                <div>
                  <h3>Ease of usability</h3>
                  <p>Cookbook has been designed from the ground up with the whole family in mind. From the smallest little cook to the matriarch of the house. Cookbook makes it easy to categorize and enjoy or your family recipes in an organized space.</p>

                <div>
                  <h3>Food is more than food</h3>
                  <p>Mindfulness is important in all of life's rooms — the kitchen included. Reading your cookbooks helps you understand everything from the organization of a menu to the relationships between flavors.</p>
